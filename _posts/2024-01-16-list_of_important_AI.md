As I am putting together more work for the AI exhibit, it is becoming clear just how many pivotal models exist. As the list continues to grow, it only makes sense to make an itemized list of them. See below for what I have collected and the appropriate links I have gathered to understand them.

## Cybernetic/Connectionist
 - [Nervous Net](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02478259) (Warren S. McCulloch & Walter Pitts - 1943):<br>
This is the initial preposition of a Neural Network. The action of a nervous system is seen as an "all-or-none" (binary) system where the decision to activate is the result of some function of preceding nodes. The ideas set in this paper do not directly shadow the current structure of nodes, weights, and activation functions, but contain the fundamental ideas that motivate those structures

- Hebbian Learning (Hebb - 1949):<br>

- [SNARC](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Stochastic_Neural_Analog_Reinforcement_Calculator) (Marvin Minksy & Dean Edmonds - 1951):<br>
"This machine is considered one of the first pioneering attempts at the field of artificial intelligence."

 - [Perceptrons](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1959-09865-001) (Frank Rosenblatt - 1958):<br>
The structure of this model is very close to the Multilayered Perceptrons (MLP) that we are familiar with today. One of the key differences is that the activation function used is a step function; this is the same "all-or-none" idea as the Nervous Net. For backpropegation to be used, however, the activation function must be differentiable, and thus this model is not actually trainable in a general sense. In the paper, Rosenblatt ends up using a corrective reinforcement learning method, similar to gradient decent, but using a constant value $\Delta V$.
