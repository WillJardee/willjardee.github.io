    - Intro to AI
    - AI in research - questions?
    - How to do a lit review
      - expert opinions - need a sociologist to help carry this out
      - snowball - overkill, but might work when we really get groovin
    - Rough def of $\pi$ and $V^\pi_\theta$, currently looking at how to calculate $\nabla_\theta \log \pi_\theta$, just $g(s)$??
    - Grading: 4 papers in, one realllllly rough, others are okay. 
- What is relationship between SI, RL, and GA?
- Do more themed pres in NISL?
- What does the end goal for Yabet look like? What are we aiming for?

  - Wed: PRA research/grading
  - Thur: PRA research/grading
  - Fri: grading
  - Sat: ants research
  - Sun: break?
  - Mon: Museum
  - Tues: Museum
  - Wed: Museum
- What do we want for next week?
  - Algorithm of PPOACO
  - next couple weeks look into saphire
  - Look into the show Upload (set in 2033).
- Notes for this week:
  - IML students might be getting power to computing hub
  - Stibetz
    - russ taylor - medical robotics
    - charles lim - cochlear implants
  - backward-forward parallel of work
{:.notice}

  - better experimental design?
  - What does this mean to applying to problems? 
  - Write their results in language that makes more sense, add call for work and work going forward
- Work through Zotero backlog
- Transform into TSP problem
- Look at the application of other theoretical bases - Information theory, control theory, construction graph
- !! Look at construction graph stuff (are we trying to do the theory in the original graph or the construction graph??) - decision graph/construction graph 
- Non-stationary markov processes 
- Application fo the theory that I have found
