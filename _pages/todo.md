This is a page of my personal TODO lists. If you are not me, what are you doing?! Get out of here kid!!

**Sheppard Meeting**
- Return book
- Organize Yabet
  - Key for the lab -> get the room number to Sheppard and grab from pew (will need to get back at the end of the semester)
  - What is his objectives (for the independent study - education outreach and the like)
    - coloar and friedman
    - JSAPPHIRE:
      - no diagnosis trappings we do not need
      - Risk, will need something as a fault tree
    - Need to do a literature review on traditional approaches "Probabilistic risk assessment"
      - A lot comes from teh NASA community; from a static perspective - understanding the risk and account for them in the design
      - We are doing a dynamic approach - it seems that CTDN is the frontier
  - where do the undergrads fit into this
    - no REU
    - 4 summer interns per a year
- Museum
  - Who are the biggest players; working on timeline (there is always more and more)
- ACO
  - Help formulating policy
  - MDP is back; the transition of the pheromone matrix, $T$, is an absorbing Markov chain, but the policy from the pheromones does not follow a good MDP.
- JHU
  - Ready to use tonight 
- Explicitly, what do you want from me next week?
  - JHU outline tonight
  - Museum mockup of timeline
  - Review of ACO and the policy function; translation into advantage and value function
{:.notice}


**TODO TODAY**
- SCI-MI onboarding
- Collect RL info for sheppard
- Work on formulation of PPOACO
{:.notice}

# School
- Ph.D. annual review; ensure it is submitted
- [Animate Your Science Poster](https://www.animateyour.science/scientific-poster-design-course)

# ACO Research
[ANTS](https://www.uni-konstanz.de/ants-2024/#conference): March 24
- Commit to PPO-ACO
- Fill in the details of the pheromone update 
  - clearer theoretical constructs/how to construct
  - better experimental design?
  - What does this mean to applying to problems? 
  - Write their results in language that makes more sense, add call for work and work going forward
- Work through Zotero backlog
- Transform into TSP problem
- Look at the application of other theoretical bases - Information theory, control theory, construction graph
- !! Look at construction graph stuff (are we trying to do the theory in the original graph or the construction graph??) - decision graph/construction graph 
- Non-stationary markov processes 
- Application fo the theory that I have found

# SMART-fireS
