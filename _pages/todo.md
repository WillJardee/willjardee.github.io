This is a page of my personal TODO lists. If you are not me, what are you doing?! Get out of here kid!!

**Sheppard Meeting**
- Updates:
  - Some work on the outline
  - Been reading up on probabilistic models
  - Project for Math of ML 
- Questions
  - What is the relationship between SI, RL, GA?
  - how ot get a value function? 
  - How is the ML course? First assignment is due Sunday?
    - watch for people not doing the split correctly
    - Paul Glusha (??): watch that knn uses no kernel; you have to cite fact you are using the old code. 
    - John Jamanis: point grubber and stickler for details.
    - Megan Lee: long running code question
  - When is AML covering the PAC-approx paper?
  - Realized that I forgot to reach out to Eleanor; try for this time next week?
- Explicitly, what do you want from me next week?
  - Meeting with Eleanor
  - Formalization of ACO in the language of RL; $\pi$, $Q^\pi_\theta$, and $V^\pi_\theta$ ($\nabla_\theta \pi$?). If time perimts this should be written up as an algorithm using GAE and general policy gradient in the realm of GACO. 
  - Layout of exhibit digitalized as svg, to scale, and labeled with strategy.
  - Papers graded.
- Notes during:
  -

{:.notice}

# School
- [Animate Your Science Poster](https://www.animateyour.science/scientific-poster-design-course)

# ACO Research
[ANTS](https://www.uni-konstanz.de/ants-2024/#conference): March 24
- Commit to PPO-ACO
- Fill in the details of the pheromone update 
  - clearer theoretical constructs/how to construct
  - better experimental design?
  - What does this mean to applying to problems? 
  - Write their results in language that makes more sense, add call for work and work going forward
- Work through Zotero backlog
- Transform into TSP problem
- Look at the application of other theoretical bases - Information theory, control theory, construction graph
- !! Look at construction graph stuff (are we trying to do the theory in the original graph or the construction graph??) - decision graph/construction graph 
- Non-stationary markov processes 
- Application fo the theory that I have found

# SMART-fireS
