This is a page of my personal TODO lists. If you are not me, what are you doing?! Get out of here kid!!

**Sheppard Meeting - 01/24**
- Ants
  - 2009 absorbing Markov paper
    - I have no idea how to do research, now I am getting some idea (what I was missing was quantity and how to find related/relevant articles - especially when they aren't linked).
  - RL related paper (Policy gradient); can we apply RL theory?
  - GBAS is well understood, generalized ACO is not - is that worth investigating? What is the role of theory in CS? I'm used to unifying theories, that doesn't seem to work in engineering fields.
  - Maybe ANTS,,, with this I don't know what to do... delay Master's a year?
- JHU
  - Do you cover Transformers at all?
  - How much material do you need out of this?
  - Deadline for the help material?
  - How much of AlphaStar do you want? Need: __A3C__ struct for __transformers__ for __relational inductive bias__, deep __LSTM__ core, __auto-regressive__ policy head with a __pointer network__, centralized __value baseline__.
- Fire
  - Give me more details on what my part will be
  - updated timeline/details?

- Work through Zotero backlog
- Transform into TSP problem
- Review other work - [Binary Chains](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11721-012-0074-3), [GBA](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167739X00000443)
- Look at the application of other theoretical bases - Information theory, control theory
- !! Look at construction graph stuff (are we trying to do the theory in the original graph or the construction graph??) - decision graph/construction graph

- Application fo the theory that I have found
- PPO-ACO

# SMART-fireS
