Hello! I am Will Jardee, a current graduate student at Montana State
University, Bozeman. I am currently studying Computer Science, focusing on
mathematical modeling of machine learning models (primarily swarm intelligence
models) and how their hyperparameters effect their behavior. I have a passion
for teaching and accessibility, as everyone has the potential to learn and
often the missing piece are tools with them in mind. 

This website is a continuous work-in-progress, and I am working off a fork of
[academicpages](https://academicpages.github.io/), so I apologize in advanced
for any broken links, lack of features, or other general jank. Take a peak
around, and hopefully you find something useful hiding in the corners.

Take a peak at my [CV](./cv) - that should have the most up-to-date information
about my work!
