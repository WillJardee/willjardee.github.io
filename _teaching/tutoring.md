This is a collection of tutoring jobs I have help, primarily as an undergraduate student.

[Hillman Scholars](https://www.montana.edu/hillemanscholars/index.html)
======
I did drop in tutoring for thirty plus (30+) class cocurrently for the Allen Yarnell Center for Student Success (AYCSS) from Summer 2021 to the end of Spring 2022. This job focused at providing free educational resources to primarily first generation Montanan college students and students showing problematic patterns in failing classes. This job required both proficient domain knowledge and adaptable, creative teaching styles.

[Math and Stats Center](https://math.montana.edu/undergrad/msc/)
======
I served as a select few undergraduate students capable of serving all primary math courses (algebra through advanced calculus), introductory statistics cources, and developmental math courses. This job overlapped with the Hillman Scholars job (from Fall 2021 to the end of Spring 2022). This job required complete knowledge of every class in the lower-division suite offered and the ability to hastily direct students in a way that allows the to teach themselves in teh future.

[Smarty Cats Tutoring](https://www.montana.edu/aycss/success/smartycats/)
======
I did twenty plus (20+) hours of one-on-one tutoring on all lower-division physics, math, and computer science courses, as well as numerous upper-division courses when needed from Fall 2019 to Spring 2020. This job required developing relationships with reoccuring students, teaching study habits, and a more indepth understanding of each topic. During the Covid-19 pandemic, I helped guide the AYCSS on how to best provide high-quality tutoring to students digitally.

[The Rock](https://therockyc.org/)
======
I briefly served as a "on-call" tutor the The Rock Youth Center. This job served less to teach high school students, and more to reassure them in their own abilities.
